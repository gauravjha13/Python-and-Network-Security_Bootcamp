<b> Hashing </b> <br>
Hashing is a method of cryptography that converts any form of data into a unique string of text. Any piece of data can be hashed, no matter its size or type.<br>
Hashing is a mathematical operation that is easy to perform, but extremely difficult to reverse.<br>
The most widely used hashing functions are MD5, SHA512, blake2b and SHAKE_256.<br>
